# Directions

# Each snippet has an intentional bug. Your tasks for each problem:

# Read the code carefully.
# Run the program. Read the error message.
# Spot and fix the problem.
# Explain what the code is supposed to do. Leave a comment at the end of the file or annotate the code line by line.
# Developer workflow or each problem:

# paste the ruby code as is
# make a commit "debug missing 'end' problem"
# fix the problem
# make commit "solve missing 'end' problem"
