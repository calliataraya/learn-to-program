# 📘 Learn to Program

Hi! I'm Callia. I'm learning to program in Ruby by working through [_Learn to Program_ by Chris Pine](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). This repo is a curated collection of practice problems, challenges, and projects that reinforce my understanding of Ruby programming fundamentals.

My goal is to become a professional Ruby on Rails web application developer — and this is the first step in my journey.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repo tracks my progress as I learn programming concepts like:

- Variables and data types
- Methods and control flow
- Arrays and iterators
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Clean, idiomatic Ruby syntax

Practice exercises are grouped and version-controlled with Git. Problems are solved, reviewed, and refined via pull requests.

## 🧠 Practice-Driven Learning

To reinforce my learning, I’m working through **realistic Ruby and Rails-focused practice problems** created as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/calliataraya/learn-to-program/issues). These simulate real-world developer workflows.

Each issue is:

- Scoped as a single feature or bug
- Solved in its own branch and submitted via PR
- Reviewed asynchronously with feedback before merge

This trains me in:

- Writing clean, idiomatic Ruby code
- Working with Git, GitHub, and Pull Requests
- Code review and iterative improvement

## 🤝 Mentorship & AI Assistance

I’m learning independently, but I’m fortunate to receive guidance from my dad, [@roberttaraya](https://github.com/roberttaraya), a professional Ruby on Rails developer. He helps review my PRs and suggests practice problems.

We also use ChatGPT to:

- Design structured problem sets and test challenges
- Reinforce concepts from the _Learn to Program_ book
- Simulate Rails-style exercises

This helps make my self-taught journey more rigorous, structured, and practical.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Developer Workflow

To simulate a real-world developer workflow, I follow this structure for working on GitHub Issues:

### 🔄 Branching (1 branch per Issue)

- Create one new branch per GitHub Issue (topic).
- Example:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/flow-control
  ```

### ✅ Commit Strategy (1 commit per problem)

- Commit after each problem is complete and working.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git add odd_or_even_checker.rb
  git commit -m "Add odd/even checker solution"
  ```

### 🔃 Pull Request Strategy

- Open a **Draft PR** after completing the first problem.
- Push updates as you solve more problems.
- Ask for feedback with: `"Ready for review"`.
- Finalize with a completed PR ready for merge.

This helps reinforce:

- Proper branching practices
- Clean commit histories
- Working in small, testable units
- Receiving and responding to code reviews

## 🔁 Code + Git Workflow

```bash
# Write your solution and test it locally.
# When ready, follow this:

git status                  # check for changes
git add .                   # stage files
git commit -m "add msg"     # commit with a concise descriptive message
git push                    # push to GitHub
```
